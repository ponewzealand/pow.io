## Abstract

The sub-ice platelet layer (SIPL) is a crystallized and porous layer of ice situated between the ocean and floating sea ice, found in the vicinity of ice shelves. During the 2024/25 Antarctic season, as part of the K892 fileld team, we measured the spatial distribution of the SIPL in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We used a geophysical instrument called the Geonics Ltd EM31-MK2 (EM-31) which transmits primary magnetic fields and records smaller secondary magnetic fields, the latter induced by the conductive sea water below. In the most simple case, the strength of the induced magnetic field enables estimation of sea ice thickness.

The purpose of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the SIPL, monitor its presence, and track any changes in McMurdo Sound. I will present the research methods used during my fieldwork, share my experiences on the ice, outline the objectives of my Masterâ€™s project, and discuss some preliminary results from my analysis.
