## Abstract

Anomalous Shoaling Drives the Longest Marine Heatwave on the Campbell Plateau

Globally, 2023 was one of the hottest years on record, accompanied by widespread and persistent marine heatwaves (MHWs). Within the New Zealand Subantarctic Zone, the Campbell Plateau experienced an exceptional 209-day MHW from 1st January to 28th July 2023, (reaching >2°C anomaly at its peak).
This talk will explore a chapter from my MSc research, which used output from the Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate (B-SOSE) to compute a closed mixed-layer temperature budget (MLTB) to investigate the spatial structure and physical mechanisms that drove the onset of this event.
This presentation will discuss B-SOSE’s performance in reproducing surface and sub-surface temperature and salinity on Campbell Plateau, and then the results of the MLTB analysis.
To further isolate the dominant drivers of the 2022/23 MHW, a Reynolds decomposition was performed on the MLTB, revealing that the onset and prolonged warming on the Campbell Plateau was driven by anomalous shoaling of the mixed layer rather than surface heat fluxes.
