## Abstract

[Seascope Aotearoa](https://www.seascope.io/aotearoa) is a free, open-access web application that amalgamates a wide range of observational data within New Zealandâ€™s marine environment and provides a simple, intuitive interface for the public. The platform integrates near real time waves, water levels, sea temperatures, subsurface profiles, coastal meteorological stations and coastal cameras. The system relies on open access from initiatives such as the Aotearoa Moana Observing System,  Argo, and the WMO Global Drifter program. Regional councils and university monitoring programmes are key contributors, along with ports, defence, aquaculture and offshore industries. 

To complement these important observations, Seascope Aotearoa provides colocated tide predictions, wind forecasts, and high-resolution wave forecasts - including spectrograms. The combined view of measured and nowcast site-specific parameters allows users to better assess the current conditions and anticipate short term changes in the conditions. The system is designed to support decision-making for a broad range of users, from the general public to marine professionals, and its modular architecture built on the OCEANUM.IO Datamesh enables rapid integration of new datasets or adaptation for other regions and thematic applications.
