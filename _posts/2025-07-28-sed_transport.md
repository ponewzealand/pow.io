## Abstract

Using data from a year-long mooring deployment in Wilson Canyon, Ross Sea, we are trying to identify and characterise turbidity flows and dense water cascades. We are also using regional datasets to investigate the origin of water masses and sediment in the canyon, and to try and determine triggers for events captured by the mooring. This brief update will cover the work done so far, and future work being carried out by a PhD student at the University of Plymouth.
