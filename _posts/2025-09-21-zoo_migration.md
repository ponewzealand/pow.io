## Abstract

Exploring the Diel Vertical Migration by South Pacific Subtropical Zooplankton at Rangitāhua

Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) is a widespread behaviour seen in diverse zooplankton taxa that connects epipelagic and mesopelagic food webs and influences biogeochemical cycles. However, the geographic and taxonomic variability of DVM remains poorly studied in the extensive South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG), particularly at its western edge around the remote island Rangitāhua (Raoul Island), a site of high cultural significance for the iwi Ngāti Kuri. This research, forming the first chapter of my PhD, aims to assess the vertical distribution and migration of zooplankton taxa at Rangitāhua and explore how environmental conditions contribute to these patterns. Research utilises in situ zooplankton samples collected with a MOCNESS (Multiple Opening Closing Nets and Environmental Sampling System) in 50 m depth layers between 0-300 m, alongside multifrequency active acoustic data and CTD tows, from surveys done southeast and southwest of Rangitāhua in spring 2022 and winter 2024. Preliminary results show depth-structed community composition, with increased abundance of most taxa in the upper 100 m. Overall nocturnal DVM patterns were observed in both sites and seasons, likely as a predator-avoidance strategy in the oligotrophic waters where light has an important influence, but at varying strengths. DVM patterns were also highly taxa specific. This study represents the first whole-community assessment of zooplankton at Rangitāhua, helping to improve understanding of how the local marine ecosystem functions and to inform future iwi-led management of the region.
